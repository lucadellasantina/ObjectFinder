% *Colocalization - Manual analysis*
% *This scripts allows to analyze whether each object found by ObjectFinder
% is co-localized to another signal of interest (loaded as image stack)
% The user is asked to review each object and judge whether is co-localized
% or non-colocalized to the signal of interest*
%
% Ask user to check only objects that were flagged as NOT colocalized
%
% Originally written for the colocalization of postsynaptic PSD95 puncta
% and presynaptic CtBP2 puncta.
%
% depends on: colocDotStackCutter.m  colocVideoFig.m
